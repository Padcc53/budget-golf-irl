            <p>Hi, Welcome to Golfing in Ireland On A Budget</p><br>
            <p>If you are coming to Ireland to play golf or perhaps you live here and are new to golf and you want to find out more about the practicalities and how to plan a great golf event, then you are in the right place.</p><br>
            <p>There are many tour operators and golf packages you can purchase, they are expensive, any discounts they get go their bottom line and not your budget.</p><br>
            <p>If you do the planning yourself and book in advance you can save yourself some money to spend on the more expensive course(s) and you can work to your own schedule and to your own needs, not the tour operators.</p><br>
            <p>Planning is an investment in time that will make your trip more enjoyable and it's not as difficult or time consuming once you know the right questions to ask and where to look for the correct information.</p><br>
            <p>As we come out of Covid 19 this golf season, there are some great deals to be had. I just booked Royal County Down, Ardglass and Concur Woods, three good quality golf courses, for two hundred euros. That's about a sixty percent discount from normal pricing. So let's get planning !!!</p>
