      <p>Weather is such a big factor especially if you have shelled out to play a links course.</p><br>
      <p>As a rule of thumb from October to early March the weather is in the lap of the Gods you could get anything. </p><br>
      <p>From mid March to early October you can hope for the best but in Ireland with weather you always plan for the worst. </p><br>
      <p>The best website to use is ireland's national weather forecasting service which is called Met Eireann and you can find it <a href="https://www.met.ie/" target="_blank">here</a></p><br>
      <p>Remember that everyone plays in the same conditions, so no point in getting frustrated by the elements</p><br>

    <h2>Weather Gear</h2>

    <p>I remember playing the Old Head in Kinsale and being astonished at the price they were charging for rain tops and pants.  The shop staff said many guests arrive without proper gear and it's a major revenue earner for the club.</p><br>

     <p>If you are coming to Ireland and going to play golf for a couple of days you need at least two pairs of shoes, two sets of rain gear, if you get power washed and I have many's a time on golf courses the first set of gear will not be dry in a day. Also a wooly hat or two to keep the head warm and the regular hat should be in the bag, good to go.</p><br>
      
      <p>You can get a pair of weather gloves for rainy days.</p><br>
      
      <p>Big golf umbrellas when caught by the wind are no fun, the Mary Poppins look on a golf course is not good.  Small umbrella only where necessary, the hats will keep you dry in the wind.</p><br>
      
      <p>Finally, the best way to deal with the cold is many thin layers rather than a couple of thick layers. The air surrounding your body gets trapped and it heats up against your body. It's also easier to swing this way as well.</p>
