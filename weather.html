            <p>Weather is such a big factor especially if you have shelled out to play a links course.</p><br>
            <p>As a rule of thumb from October to early March the weather is in the lap of the Gods you could get anything. </p><br>
            <p>From mid March to early October you can hope for the best but in Ireland with weather you always plan for the worst. </p><br>
            <p>The best website to use is ireland's national weather forecasting service which is called Met Eireann and you can find it <a href="https://www.met.ie/" target="_blank">here</a></p><br>
            <p>Remember that everyone plays in the same conditions, so no point in getting frustrated by the elements</p><br>

      <h3>How Many In Your Group</h3>
      <p>A small group four or less gives you standard pricing</p><br>
      <p>A bigger group let's say six or more means for most mid to expensive courses, you can definately try for a cheap rate at off peak hours</p><br>
      <p>A group of twelve or more, the mid price to expensive courses will negociate especially if it's a resort and accomodation is in play as well</p><br>
      <p>The bigger the group you have, the more advantageous is it to book as early as you can.</p>
     </div>
    
    <div class="plancriteria">
      <h3>Where to play and when</h3>
      <p>Start with the cheap course and then the expensive course and repeat.</p>
      <p> Playing the cheap course first gets your game warmed up for the course you are spending more money on.</p><br>
      <p> Mixing in the cheaper courses means people have more leeway to enjoy the night before and I think the multi day trips tend to be more fun this way</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="plancriteria">
      <h3>Accomodation</h3>
      <p>If you can stay within 90 Kms, stay in the same place for multiple nights for cheap rates</p>
      <p>If you have an early morning start it means being close to the course the night before. Do not tire yourself out for golf by getting up early to travel</p><br>
      <p>You will avoid being stiff after the journey and you can get a good breakfast into you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plancriteria">
      <h3>Travel</h3>
      <p>Groups of eight or more should consider a mini bus, the cost divided up means less driving on narrow roads</p>
      <p>Otherwise car hire is the way to go. Be careful you do not get scammed by the car hire companies Read <a href="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/revealed-how-car-rental-companies-are-charging-customers-for-pre-existing-damage-and-not-actually-repairing-vehicles-37691502.html" target="_blank">this</a></p>
