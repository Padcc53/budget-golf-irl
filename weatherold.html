            <p>Weather is such a big factor especially if you have shelled out to play a links course.</p><br>
            <p>As a rule of thumb from October to early March the weather is in the lap of the Gods you could get anything. </p><br>
            <p>From mid March to early October you can hope for the best but in Ireland with weather you always plan for the worst. </p><br>
            <p>The best website to use is ireland's national weather forecasting service which is called Met Eireann and you can find it <a href="https://www.met.ie/" target="_blank">here</a></p><br>
            <p>Remember that everyone plays in the same conditions, so no point in getting frustrated by the elements</p><br>

      <p>I am not being sponsored or paid, the information presented here is based on my experience.
      I would love to have your opinion via our feedback page on any course you played or experiences you had. </p><br>
      
      <p>Congratulations on picking Ireland, it is a premier golf destination and there is great golf to be played and enjoyed on our famous and not so famous courses in Ireland.</p><br>
